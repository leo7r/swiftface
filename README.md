abstract = {Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret the visual world in a way similar to that of humans. Due to the rapid advancements in technology and the increasing availability of sufficiently large training datasets, the topics within computer vision have experienced a steep growth in the last decade. Among them, one of the most promising fields is face detection. Being used daily in a wide variety of fields; from mobile apps and augmented reality for entertainment purposes, to social studies and security cameras; designing high-performance models for face detection is crucial. On top of that, with the aforementioned growth in face detection technologies, precision and accuracy are no longer the only relevant factors: for real-time face detection, speed of detection is essential. SwiftFace is a novel deep learning model created solely to be a fast face detection model. By focusing only on detecting faces, SwiftFace performs 30\% faster than current state-of-the-art face detection models.},
